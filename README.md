I made a sandbox where you can test and make some levels and save them in the csv format, everything is quite straightforward
Controls:
For level editor (main.py):
  Left and right arrow keys to move left and right
  click to select a block
  Right click to erase a block
For GamePlay(game.py):
  WASD - to move
  Q - to throw bombs
  SPACE - to shoot
